## Phase 1 Project: World Population Dashboard

### Link: https://hcoco1.github.io/Phase1_app/

#### Project Pitch

**World Population Dashboard (WPD)** is an HTML/CSS/JS app that accesses data from a web service (https://world-population-dashboard.onrender.com/countries). WPD returns a collection of countries. Each object has six attributes (country, area_in_Square_Kilometers, population, flagUrl, and message). The App fetches all the data as soon the browser load. Also, users can search for a specific country using an HTML form and sort the collection by their properties.
Moreover, users can add a new country. Finally, users can leave personalized messages on the text box input.
