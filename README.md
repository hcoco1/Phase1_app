# I am actively working on this unfinished App. 

## Phase 1 Project: World Population Dashboard

Project Pitch

**World Population Dashboard (WPD)** is an HTML/CSS/JS app that accesses data from a db.json file using a JSON server. WPD returns a collection of 297 countries. Each object has six attributes (country, area_in_Square_Kilometers, population, male_population, female_population, and flagUrl). The App fetches all the data as soon the browser load. Also, users can search for a specific country using an HTML form and sort the collection by their properties.

Moreover, the user can check the information for a specific country and add a new or different flag. Finally, users can leave personalized messages by clicking on a country flag.
