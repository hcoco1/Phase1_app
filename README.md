# `Phase 1 Project: World Population Dashboard`
## Learning Goals

---

**World Population Dashboard (WPD)** is a HTML/CSS/JS app that accesses  data from a db.json file using a     json-server. WPD return a colection of 297 countries around the world and each object has six attributes (country, area_in_Square_Kilometers, Population, male_population, female_population and flagUrl) . All interactions are handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

# Project Structure




* **WPD** run on a single page and contain a single HTML, CSS and JS files.

* **WPD** use  four distinct event listeners (two submit events, one change event and one click event). What this means is that, if you had 2 click events, that would only count as 1 distinct event and you would need to add at least 1 more. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should also have its own unique callback function. These must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method. Events embedded into HTML elements and CSS will not count toward the total. Please ask your instructor if you have questions regarding this requirement.

* Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

* Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
