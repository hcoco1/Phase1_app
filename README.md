#### Project Pitch

**World Population Dashboard (WPD)** is an HTML/CSS/JS app that accesses data from a web service (https://world-population-dashboard.onrender.com/countries).
A json() file was created from free internet data and deployed in a web server. WPD returns a collection of countries, and the App fetches all data as soon as the browser loads. Users can search for a country using an HTML form and sort the collection by properties.
Moreover, users can add a new country. Finally, users can leave personalized messages on the text box input.
